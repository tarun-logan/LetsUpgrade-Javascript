    <h1>Question 7</h1>
    <p> An integer number greater than 1 is called a prime if it cannot be divided without a remainder by anything
        except 1 and itself.<br>
        In other words, n > 1 is a prime if it canâ€™t be evenly divided by anything except 1 and n.<br>
        For example, 5 is a prime, because it cannot be divided without a remainder by 2, 3 and 4.
    </p>
    <h2>Write the code which outputs prime numbers in the interval from 2 to n.<br>
        For n = 10 the result will be 2,3,5,7.
    </h2>
    <h3>P.S. The code should work for any n, not be hard-tuned for any fixed value</h3>
    <h4>Check the console for output</h4>
